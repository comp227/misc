# Web application development exercise draft

> This is draft language for the final project and is completely subject to change

In the exercise, a freely chosen application is implemented using React and/or Node. A mobile application implemented with React Native is also possible, in which case the recommended development platform is [Expo](https://expo.io/).

So the backend of the application does not have to be implemented on Node. You also don't have to implement the backend yourself, ready-made interfaces or services such as Firebase are fine. It is also possible to make the frontend in some other reasonable way than React, e.g. Vue.js. In this case, it would be good if the application had a backend made with Node.

The work is graded on a pass/fail scale. The only thing that can lead to rejection is that you haven't done your work yourself, or if the time records and the commit history of the GitHub repository do not match each other. All the time used to make the application is counted as working hours, so even if you make the backend with a technology other than Node, it is still counted as working time.

Working hours *does not count* the time spent reviewing things in the course.

It is also possible to do the exercise in pairs or groups.

## Registration and subject approval

If you use techniques familiar from the course in the exercise, you do not need to approve the subject. If you use any other techniques, make sure that the topic is suitable by discussing it via Discord

## What to turn in

The README.md file of your GitHub repository should have a link to where the application is running. For the React Native mobile application implemented at Expo, there must be a [public link](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/publishing/#how-to-publish) in the repository, through which the application can be started in the Expo mobile application. In other cases, demoing the application is agreed on a case-by-case basis.

The README must also contain a link to the application's user manual and work time accounting. The appropriate level of accuracy for working time accounting is below:

# timekeeping

| day | time | what i did |
| :----:|:-----| :-----|
| 18.2. | 3 | getting to know JavaFX |
| 19.2. | 3 | preliminary implementation of the user interface, creation of todos |
| 20.2. | 3 | user management, save to file, structure refactoring |
| | 2 | refactoring the structure of the application |
| | 2 | specification document |
| 21.2. | 4 | architectural description |
| | 5 | testing |
| 4.3. | 1 | code refactoring |
| 5.3. | 2 | specification of architectural description |
| | 1 | manual |
| 6.3. | 2 | testing |
| total | 28 | |

Work time accounting and repository commit history should match each other to a reasonable extent. So make sure that you are committing frequently!

Everyone must keep their own time records, even in pair or groupwork
