# Full Stack -web development project

In the project you create an application of your choice with React and/or Node. Also a mobile application created with React Native is possible.

The backend for the application does not have to be in Node. Backend does not have to be self made, ready interfaces or services such as Firebase will do. Frontend is also possible to make with some other reasonable way than React, e.g. with Vue.js, in which case it is recommended for the application have a Node backend.

To get a failing grade the application is not done by yourself or if the hour keeping and GitHub commit history do not match. All the hours put into the project are counted, so even working a backend with something other than Node, counts.

## Requirements for the returned application

At the README of your repository has to have a link to an address, where the application is running. If you're creating a mobile application, demo will be scheduled individually.

Also, in the README a link to use instructions and working hours keeping are required. Precision level for time keeping is [this](https://github.com/mluukkai/OtmTodoApp/blob/master/dokumentaatio/tuntikirjanpito.md). The time keeping **must include the total sum of spent hours**.

Time keeping and repository commit history must match each other in reason. Do intermediate commits!

If working with a pair or a group, everyone keeps their own hours.
